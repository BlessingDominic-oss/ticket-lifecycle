### Communication
Agent John sees this is a Sev-A (emergency) ticket and reassigns it to a System Administrator. He leaves a proper message:

### Working the issue
System Administrator agent Jane Doe logs in:

Agent Jane works the issue and communicates back to agent John. She also changes the status of the ticket from **open** to **resolved**:

### Resolution
Support agent John sees in his portal that System Administrator Jane left a message and that the ticket is now closed:

This was a simplistic scenario showing ticket creation, assignment, agent communication, and resolution. Tickets can also be reassigned, escalated in severity, or routed to a different department depending on business impact.

Help desk agents can expect to handle anywhere from **10 to 100 tickets** per day depending on company size.

I hope this tutorial helps you understand the general ticket lifecycle.
